Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant manner. It consists of a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions, linked through cryptographic hashes. The decentralized nature of blockchain eliminates the need for a central authority, fostering trust and transparency. Transactions on the blockchain are secure, as altering one block would require changing all subsequent blocks, a computationally infeasible task. Blockchain finds applications in various industries, including finance, supply chain, healthcare, and more, offering a revolutionary approach to data management and fostering a new era of digital trust.
