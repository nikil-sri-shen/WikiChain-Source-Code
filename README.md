## **Overview**

**WikiChain** is a cutting-edge, robust, and highly scalable knowledge management system designed to provide a resilient and pseudo-transparent infrastructure for managing and sharing information. It leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized and immutable database of knowledge that offers unprecedented reliability, security, and trustworthiness. Unlike traditional knowledge bases, WikiChain empowers users with transparent yet privacy-conscious methods for storing and accessing valuable data.

## **Key Features**

- **Decentralized Knowledge Management**: WikiChain utilizes blockchain's decentralized nature to ensure no central authority controls the data, providing a transparent and democratized knowledge-sharing experience.
- **Resilience and Redundancy**: Built to withstand failures and ensure data availability, WikiChain ensures continuous operation even in the event of system crashes, network issues, or malicious attacks.
- **Immutability and Security**: By leveraging the core principles of blockchain technology, data added to WikiChain is immutable and cryptographically secure, making it tamper-proof and resistant to unauthorized modifications.
- **Pseudo-Transparency**: Users have the ability to view and interact with data in a way that is transparent yet privacy-preserving. Sensitive information is encrypted, allowing for privacy without compromising the integrity of the data.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: WikiChain is designed to scale easily, handling increasing amounts of data and users without sacrificing performance or security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that allows users to contribute to and query the knowledge base efficiently.
- **Smart Contracts Integration**: Utilizing Ethereum-based smart contracts, WikiChain enables automated processes such as token-based reward systems for contributors or content verification.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Blockchain**: WikiChain is powered by Ethereum, ensuring secure and transparent data management.
- **Smart Contracts**: The use of smart contracts enables automatic, tamper-proof execution of tasks such as permissions, data validation, and access controls.
- **React & Node.js**: For the frontend and backend, WikiChain employs modern JavaScript technologies, including React for dynamic, responsive interfaces and Node.js for building a scalable backend.
- **Solidity**: The Ethereum-based smart contracts are written in Solidity, offering flexibility and security for decentralized applications.

## **Installation & Setup**

To get started with WikiChain, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WikiChain.git
    cd WikiChain
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   - For the **client** (React frontend):
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     ```

   - For the **server** (Node.js backend):
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

   - For **smart contracts** (Ethereum contracts):
     ```bash
     cd smart_contracts
     npm install
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   - Start the **client** (React):
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```

   - Start the **server** (Node.js):
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm start
     ```

   - Deploy and test **smart contracts**:
     Follow the instructions in the `smart_contracts` folder to deploy your contracts on an Ethereum test network.

## **Usage**

Once the application is running, you can interact with the WikiChain platform by:

- **Contributing Knowledge**: Add new articles, information, or insights to the knowledge base using a simple form. Each entry will be stored securely and immutably on the blockchain.
- **Querying Knowledge**: Search for articles, topics, or insights stored within the system. The decentralized nature of WikiChain ensures results are accurate and unaltered.
- **Access Control**: Depending on the permissions granted, users can either view, contribute, or moderate content. Access control is managed by the integrated smart contracts.
- **Rewards System**: Contributors earn tokens for sharing valuable knowledge. This incentivizes quality contributions and fosters an active knowledge-sharing community.
